# ROS_Packages

In this repository I have created simple ROS Packages which I use to check the functioning of mobile robots. 

#Check Odometry 
This ROS package is used to publish odometry data

#rotate_robot
This ROS package is used to rotate the robot around the axis. 

#simple_controller
A simple controller has been designed to move the robot from point A to point B
